# 3372. Maximize the Number of Target Nodes After Connecting Trees I

## Problem Description
Briefly summarize the problem here. For example:

Given two trees and a set of target nodes, your task is to connect the trees strategically to maximize the number of target nodes reachable after connection. The problem involves graph/tree concepts and optimization techniques.

## Solution Approach
Describe your approach or algorithm here, such as:

- Building adjacency lists for trees
- Using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore nodes
- Strategically connecting the trees to maximize reachable target nodes

## Code Implementation
Provide a link or mention the main code file that contains your solution.

## How to Run
Instructions to run your code, such as:

```bash  
# compile or run your program  
python no3372.py
